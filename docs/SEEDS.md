# Seed Nodes

Seed nodes help new nodes discover peers.

## Status
- **TBD** (add after stable public nodes are online)

## Format
- DNS seeds: `seed1.example.org`, `seed2.example.org`
- Fixed seeds (IPs) are discouraged unless necessary

## Notes
- Only add reliable, monitored nodes
- Avoid single points of failure
